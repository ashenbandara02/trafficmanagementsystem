# 🚦 Traffic Management System

Welcome to the **Traffic Management System** repository! This project aims to develop an integrated approach for urban traffic management and real-time transit information dissemination using IoT technology. Our goal is to enhance traffic efficiency, reduce congestion, and provide commuters with real-time information for a smoother travel experience.

## 📋 Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project include:

- **IoT Sensor Deployment**: Implementing sensors to monitor traffic flow, environmental conditions, and public transit status.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Analyzing collected data to optimize traffic signals and manage incidents promptly.
- **User Engagement**: Providing commuters with up-to-date transit information through digital displays and mobile applications.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Traffic Flow Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of vehicle speed, count, and direction.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking air quality, weather conditions, and noise levels.
- **Public Transit Updates**: Live updates on bus and train schedules, delays, and arrivals.
- **Incident Management**: Immediate detection and reporting of traffic incidents to relevant authorities.
